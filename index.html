<h2>Ebere Prince Chigozirim</h2>
<h2>Papa Jay</h2>
<p>Papa Jay is a good man form Aba Nigeria. Currently enrolled as a student in BYUI. And i am  in pursuit of a degree in Applied Technology. I choose this course because i felt that the world need me here, and secondly i feel happy working on laptop or helping with any computer challenge. Hopefully i am going to be a guru in web and other programming stuff.  
</p>
<p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and i also served a full time mission. I live with my favourite cousin very close to Aba Nigeria Temple.</p>
<p>I came back to BYU because it gives me the opportunity to learn in a loving envoironment, out instructor and fellow students share their knowledge and experiences with love, these feelings has help me to understand difficult things more easily and has help me build my confidence too. I love to play soccer</p>
<p>Presently i work in a water treatment company, as the production manager. it is my responsibility to make sure we produce healthy clean water that is testless for the public.</p>
